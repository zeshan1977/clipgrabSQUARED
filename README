Compiling ClipGrab is really easy.

You will only need the Qt4 developer libraries in order to compile the program.
In addition, ffmpeg (no developer libs necessary) needs to be installed.


sudo apt-get install ffmpeg -y
sudo apt-get install qt4-dev-tools -y
sudo apt-get -f install -y
sudo apt-get installi libqtwebkit-dev




To compile ClipGrab, simply execute
qmake clipgrab.pro && make

This will create an executable "clipgrab" that you can start via ./clipgrab.
